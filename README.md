### 👨🏾‍💻 About Me

I’m a learner of the ALX Software Engineering Program with a specialization in **Backend Web Development** and a graduate of the **ALX Data Science Track**. My journey into tech began with a fascination for how data drives decisions and how systems stay secure in a connected world.

What fuels me is the intersection of **code, data, and defense**. I believe a great cybersecurity expert is not just reactive but proactive and able to understand the backend, anticipate threats, and secure systems holistically.
