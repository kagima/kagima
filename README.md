## 🧠 About Me

I began my journey in tech through data science, driven by a desire to uncover insights and understand how data could power smarter decisions. That curiosity evolved into a passion for backend development—where systems are built, secured, and optimized.  

Today, I’m pursuing backend web development through the ALX Software Engineering Program and combining it with my data science foundation to pursue a future in cybersecurity.

My long-term vision is to become a well-rounded cybersecurity expert who understands systems inside out—from the backend logic to the security architecture that protects them.

My approach to learning is hands-on and intentional. I thrive in collaborative, problem-solving environments and believe that truly impactful tech is thoughtful, ethical, and secure.
